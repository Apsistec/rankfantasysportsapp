    { title: 'Where did Rank Fantasy $ports, the idea come from?', info: 'The team at RFSports is made up of of a group of skilled DFS players who have been participating regularly on the online DFS platforms for several years now.  Having participated regularly, it did not take long to realize the vast amount of time required to not only determine which key stats to track when creating an strategy, but also the time spent everyday actually tracking the stats, maintaining the databases, researching additional public resources and reviewing social sites in order to truly make "skilled decisions" vs "outright guessing".  It is fairly common knowledge that many DFS players will gladly invest countless hours tracking and analyzing their favorite sports, right?  But, sadly it also comes as no surprise that time is typically a major limiting factor, since most everyone often has to spend more time doing other things like woking, maintaining relationships with families and loved ones, as well as any number of other activities and responsibilities.  This leads many, 60% of all DFS players, in the direction of finding and utilizing one or more of the existing sets of tools and services like those found on the various DFS related sites across the web. Problem is, when you actually dive in and start learning how to use those tools and services you soon realize that you are back where you started from. For instance, you can see with many other sites that offer the tools necessary for playing DFS that the sheer amount of data to process and the number of ways you can manipulate and visualize the data is near limitless.  You can easily find yourself "in the weeds" just trying to determine which tools to use, learning how they work, and then you still have figure out how to use the tools effeciently and effectively to get the results you want.  Ultimately we saw the need for a service like RFSports in the market, one where you only get the data you need in order to make more informed decisions and that automatically saves time and eliminates frustration. So, with a many long nights and extra determination we finally started to realize the potential of joining forces to bring together each persons unique skills thus maximizing our collective knowledge, which brings us to today. Now, we continue to develop our skills and grow together as we continue to establish one of the best sources of winning information available in fantasy sports!' },
