<h3>Memberships</h3>
<p><strong>Billing:</strong>Subscription fees for the PRO Membership are recurring payments (except where identified as otherwise and when they become available, such as a Lifetime Membership and any Single Item Purchases).  The term may be monthly, semi-annual, or annual, as described in the course of the transaction.  Your subscription begins upon payment of the first installment of subscription fees.  The subscription renews at the specified interval as applicable upon the payment of automatically recurring subscription fees.  Monthly or annual fees are charged on the same day of the month that the subscription began, except in the following types of circumstances.  (For example, if a monthly subscription began on the 29th, 30th, or 31st day of a month, then membership will renew on the last day of any month that doesn’t have as many days.)</p>
<p><strong>Cancellations and Refunds:</strong> You may cancel your PRO Membership at any time before the end of the current billing period, and the cancellation will take effect immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Lapsed Payment: </strong>If payment for a subscription fails, the user account will be downgraded and granted a 7-day grace period to update the payment source.  If a successful payment is not made within 7 days the membership will be fully canceled.  Renewal will be subject to current prices.</p>
