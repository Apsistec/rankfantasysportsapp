The PWA provides DFS players access to publicly accessible information and tools, and paid access to a premium suite of resources and tools. Our team has designed and developed a suite of winning algorithms, game simulators, lineup optimizers, automation tools and more. Players can use the chat bot to gain insights from, discuss DFS topics with other players, and other resources. Currently our stats are housed and presented using Excel in iframes, while we continue to engineer our own data-tables and APIs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n
